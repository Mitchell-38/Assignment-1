<h1> About Me </h1>
<h3 style="color:blue;"> Name: Mitchell Broadbent Student <br> Number: s3858182 <br> Email: s3858182@student.rmit.edu.au</h3> 
<hr>
<p> I am natural-born Australian with an English speaking background. I have graduated year 12 and am undertaking a Bachelor’s degree. I have an avid interest in technology, am the owner/carer of two rats and love to read. </p>

<p> I have always been interested in IT from a young age, though I wouldn’t realise it as a viable profession until I entered the workforce and was able to see just how much society relies on the development and maintenance of information technologies. My interest wasn’t nurtured by any specific people or events, but rather a conglomeration of known figures and works both fictional and existent. I love the problem solving and diagnostic aspects of both programming and what I imagine will be systems administration. As frustrating as it can be when something goes wrong with my computer or other technologies (even my car), I love the challenge of tracing the issue and trying to find a solution. I have no formal experience in IT, but I am eager to develop some at the soonest opportunity. 
</p>
<p>
I chose to study with RMIT through Open Universities Australia as I have become disillusioned and frustrated with on-campus learning. As someone with responsibilities and needing to hold gainful employment, the physical limitations of my local university became too much to bear. The studies under my local university were particularly frustrating as attendance didn’t feel so much necessary as it was customary, and one one-hour tutorial during a weekday would rob me of an entire day of work. RMIT is a well reputed university with the degree and platform I was after, and seems best suited to providing the opportunities I need to succeed.
</p>
<p>
By studying IT with RMIT, I expect to be introduced to the industry as a whole; to be able to explore each avenue of IT with the expertise needed for me to understand and contribute to the field upon graduation. Specifically, I’m looking to understand which skills and tools are required to succeed in the industry (e.g. GitHub, HTML, SQL etc…); develop skills such as programming and systems and database management. For example, not only do I aim to learn the specific programming languages involved, I also wish to master the techniques and approaches that I can apply to specific problems I may encounter in my career. </p>

<h1> Ideal Job </h1>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/41169045?type=standout#searchRequestToken=b1061d21-4cbb-4205-8b78-6c9b097e75e3">IT Operations and Infrastructure Administrator</a>
<br>
<img src="JobAd.png"> 
<p>  As I understand it, this job would entail maintaining and managing what they refer to as ‘infrastructure systems’. IT infrastructure refers to system components that facilitate the use and management of data. This would be in the form of servers, networks and interface systems. What makes appealing to me is the sense of maintaining a system and keeping it in optimal condition. When things go wrong, I find the diagnostic methods and problem solving techniques fascinating and I think a job like this would keep me stimulated and fulfilled. </p>
<p>
This position doesn’t state any required any official qualifications to succeed, however a tertiary level education in computer sciences or IT would be vital in laying the foundations for this kind of work. The position requires experience in handling of networks and servers as well as familiarity with switches and routers, networking experience and excellent communication skills. The position also lists a number of software and systems the applicant must be familiar with in order to succeed in this role. </p>
<p> 
The skills I have in relation to a position like this are minimal. Other than some basic at-home level experience with managing a server and dealing with routers, I don’t bring much to the table and would be sorely lacking in the requirements of this position. My Year-12 level education would not be sufficient in my opinion at competency at this position. 
In order to acquire the skills necessary for this position I have enrolled at RMIT in a Bachelor of IT which I hope will supply me with the opportunities to learn these skills. The skills I plan to focus on in relation to this would be: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Information Systems</li>
    <li> Verbal/Written Communication</li>
    <li> Server Management</li>
    <li> Modem/Router Management</li>
    <li> Networking</li>
    <li> SQL</li>
</ul>
<p> However, on the job experience will also be required in my opinion before I would be ready to undertake a position like that. As such, I plan to gain experience at more entry-level positions before attempting applications such as the one above. I acknowledge that my desires and aptitudes may be incompatible with such a position at that time, and thus plan to sample other areas of the IT industry during my education and employment.

<h1> Personality Profile </h1>
<p> I have taken a number of personality tests and the results are listed below: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href ="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">Myers-Briggs</a> Personality Type: Logician INTP-A</li>
<li><a href = "https://learning-styles-online.com/inventory/questions.php?cookieset=y">Learning Style</a>:
	<ul>
	<li> Visual 50%</li>
	<li> Auditory 30%</li>
	<li> Kinesthetic 20%</li>
	</ul>
<li> <a href="https://enneagram.bz/en">Enneagram Type</a>: Type 3 - Performer</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t personally ascribe much weight to these personality tests. When filling them out, I don’t often identify particularly strongly with the best option available. I don’t think people are that cookie-cutter that they can all be accurately described within at most 16 templates. However, I concede that they can be useful when making snap judgements about someone is necessary and that they are useful in the formation of compatible group members for a shared goal. </p>
<p>
When in a team situation, knowing these results would make me put extra effort into being more communicative and receptive to external input. I know I have a tendency to work independently and would have to take steps to avoid doing that to the team’s detriment. If I had access to the MBTI of the other members, I would try to take into account their strengths and weaknesses when delegating tasks or communicating with them.
</p>
<p>
When forming a team, I should try to look for members who I believe will be more outgoing in the hopes that a mix of personality types will complement the team. Ideally, this would allow members to make up for each others shortcomings and avoid getting in each others way when it comes to how each of us prefers to operate when working.

<h1> Project </h1>

<p> The project I have chosen is the result of personal frustration and, if implemented, could vastly increase the amount of enjoyment and convenience of the tabletop gaming experience. The project is an app which would facilitate the more tedious aspects of tabletop role-playing gaming by automating dice-rolls, character generation and a number of other aspects under the guidance of the user. This would be developed with an Android phone in mind, but the concept could be applied to any device. </p>

<p>Tabletop role-playing games are often hard to learn, requiring players to read hefty, esoteric rule books and leaving new players to surmount a steep learning-curve – all before they can even start playing! Tabletop role-playing games have surged in popularity over the past decade, in large part to pop-culture, leaving scores of new players interested in seeing what tabletop games have to offer. This project attempts to take care of that by automating a lot of the mechanics, offering easy lookup, and information management. This allows players to jump straight into the action, enjoying a streamlined experience where they can learn the game in-depth at their own pace.</p>

<p>The features of this app include automatic character creation, encyclopedic lookup, inventory management, dice-rolling functionality, combat facilitation and a method for import/exporting character and items between ‘campaigns’ or settings.  <br>
New players often face challenges just creating the character for themselves before they’re even allowed to start playing. In tabletop role-playing games, players are created by making a number of informed decisions relating to the background, species and profession of their character informed through information given in the rule book. On top of that, a character requires statistical attributes assigned to them in order to define what they’re good at. This app would offer character generation whereby the player could choose a template-based preset character or to be guided through a process of selection of features and traits. <br>
Video games provide internal engines which govern the viability of actions and rule enforcement. Lacking this, tabletop role-playing games put this responsibility on the player’s themselves. Therefore, player must either become intimately informed with all aspects of the game, or have a convenient and easy method to find the relevant information. The impetus of an engaging action scene can easily be disrupted when a player has to sift through the pages of the tome-like rule books provided with the game. This app would provide players with a search bar for information, as well as sprinkling links to relevant page articles throughout. For example, if a player want to know the healing given by a particular potion, they could search for it in the app and while reading it, they would also find links to other items that provide player healing.<br>
Characters in role-playing games often come with inventories that need managing, or a list of spells they can use that need to be kept track of. The player not only has to know which items or spells they have, but how many items they can carry based on weight, or which spells they have already used. This app would allow players to keep track of items by adding it to their virtual inventory. If the item were standard to the game, its metadata would be added as well (qualities, weight, worth, etc), manual entry available if not. This would allow greater immersion for the players without the tedium of calculating weight limits and constantly keeping inventory. <br>
In tabletop role-playing games, during combat, there is a lot of dice-rolling and calculation that goes into every action taken. This can easily slow down simple minute-long encounters into a several hour session. This app would streamline the entire experience to varying desired degrees. The app could roll the required dice automatically for any action taken. For example, the player could simply indicate they wish to attack another character with a certain weapon. In under a second, the app would return results having calculated the player’s stats, the weapon’s stats and the enemy’s stats while also rolling for attack and damage, returning the consequences of the action like damage to health. 
Finally, the app would also include a method for importing or exporting characters and items from one settings to another, or simply for storage. This would merely be a link to the information hosted on the app’s servers. Character sheets would also be downloadable.</p>

<p>Tabletop role-playing games are traditionally played around a table with friends. Therefore, a portable device for this app would be ideal. Specifically with Android phones in mind, the technologies required then would be a suitable Java IDE and the computers to program it. Also, if the app were to have online functionality, server space would be required to host the information uploaded to it, and the encyclopedia itself. It would also be necessary to acquire the licensing to use information from certain games on the app if it were to be expanded beyond the SRD provided by Dungeons and Dragons and other free-to-use role-playing companies. </p>

<p>In order to develop such an app for Android phones, a high degree of Java proficiency would be necessary to write the software. It would not be too difficult to find resources for attaining the skill with Java necessary to complete the project. There are myriad sources from websites, textbooks, videos and classes dedicated to teaching programming languages (a lot of these are even free).</p>

<p>A successful outcome for this project would mean that new players to tabletop role-playing games would be able to jump straight into the action without being bogged down by all the extraneous information and lack of guidance that comes with traditional rule books. It would also facilitate and streamline a smoother and more efficient experience for experienced players. More people would be able to play in cooperative groups without thus delaying the game too long as the app would take care of all the time-consuming components. In essence, the satisfaction of its users would be the ideal outcome. </p>
